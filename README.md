### The Challenge

For the past year, I have been the sole developer and an active contributor to the project. I have crafted the application from the ground up, first in Swift, and currently in React-Native for multiplatform capabilities. The project itself has been delayed by larger institutional inertia, but the launch is scheduled to be Fall 2019.
