The Office of Sustainability is a hub for sustainability and sustainable development with a focus on applied research, 
experiential learning, operational management, and public engagement on campus and in the greater Charleston community. Our mission is bring this sustainability experience to the hands of students at the College of Charleston, with the possibility of expanding to other universities in the near future.

### The Challenge

For the past year, I have been the sole developer and an active contributor to the project. I have crafted the application from the ground up, first in Swift, and currently in React-Native for multiplatform capabilities. The project itself has been delayed by larger institutional inertia, but the launch is scheduled to be Fall 2019.
